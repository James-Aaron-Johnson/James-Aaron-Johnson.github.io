<u>Ghost Driver</u>
==============================

## A fully developed small demo of a game

A small game demo in which I was the primary developer of the game's systems and art style as well as serving as producer and narrative/mechanic design. I helped design the UI menu's along with the game's mode splitting from a first person exploration to puzzle game for each sub-area.

For this game I had the task of being the main implementer of the artwork and scripting. But I also helped my team design the game with my main areas being that of story and narrative design along with the UI designs.

Check out the game below:
