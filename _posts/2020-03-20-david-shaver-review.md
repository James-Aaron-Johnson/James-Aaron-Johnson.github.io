To end my series of peer reviews I'll finish on someone who's one of my main goals in the industry which is that of a lead game and narrative designer for a large studio. David Shaver is a triple-A designer who has worked for many big name companies and games. They can be found here at [David Shaver](http://www.davidshaver.net)

## Initial Glance
---
On first viewing all of his contact information is viewable and usable. There are detailed explanations for everything he's done on the site. His frontpage instantly shows his most recent projects and you can quickly see what he is or was doing with ease.

## Style and Aesthetic
---
The site overall is a little bit dated in terms of style although it's simplicity helps it from a usability standpoint.

## Branding
---
The site has a very consistent and strong blue and grey theme and he allows the work to speak for itself against his rather basic background. Even though this site is basic though there is still a sense of personality amgonst him and you can see who he his and what his interests are.

## Site Usability
---
There is again no favicon for some reason which is odd. However the site is clean and very simple to use. The test colours are simple to read and the contrast ratio is good although the text alignment makes it feel squished and blocky.

## Conclusion
---
Overall I honestly really like this site and I hope to replicate the style and tone with a more modern minimalist vibe.
