To start my peer reviews off I'm beginning with someone who is similar to me in terms of experience and goals. Mitchell Bennett is also a university student who's made a portfolio site to show off their own work. They can be found here at [Mitchell Bennett](https://www.projectmitch.co.uk)

## Initial Glance
---
So, on first viewing the site has a very standard and typical layout and look. It's standard of almost every site nowadays that's built with a site-builder. It's not a bad thing but it's a very generic greeting. The site starts on his up and coming projects which is a nice style, people who come to the site can see he's still active and has a recent project soon to come out. 

The portfolio projects are laid out in a logical manner and are immediately reachable to see what he's done right there on the home page. There's also a good separation between his portfolio projects, games and graphic design work. There's no easy confusion between which is which. That said, the spacing between each individual project is very large and causes the whole screen to feel very zoomed in on a 1080p screen. Images and titles could have been reduced in size and shown more on one page view rather than requiring the viewer to scroll down immediately. 

Overall, on first glance, it's a decent looking site with some nice ideas.

## Style and Aesthetic
---
The site appears to have a very sleek and modern animated style with parallax animated banners and gifs on various parts of the page. The colour choice is very neutral and doesn't have any specific tones or themes coming out beyond white and black. It's a clean site with a some dynamism added through the use of animated images and elements.

## Branding
---
Branding seems to be very graphic design based along with a lot of pixel artwork strewn about. There's a consistency with the use of images and banners. No specific colour theming as noted before. The site also makes use of the generic Weebly favicon and doesn't have a specific one for the user giving it a very amateur feel. There are also a wildly different amount of fonts and styles happening which make the site feel like a mash of everything with no clear tone.

## Site Usability
---
Site is simple to use and everything necessary is accessible within at least 2 clicks. However, the contact me icons don't do anything and provide no actual means to contact him. Likewise the email doesn't link to an email client, it's just an icon image which serves no purpose. There are several places where text elements are incredibly small for the content they're trying to show such as his about me section. There also appears to be an issue with the site when going to the Graphic Design by Mitch tab and scrolling up as it goes white and hides the nav bar.

## Conclusion
---
Overall the site works as intended for the most part and there are several elements to it that I like. However, taking a look at this site has taught quite a bit about what I might want to do for my own site such as ensuring that I don't overuse animations or styles or give too much variance in tone. Likewise I'd opt for a more minimalist layout and design to give a cleaner feel.
