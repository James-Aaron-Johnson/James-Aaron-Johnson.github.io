Continuing on with my peer reviews I'm moving up from last time and I'm looking ahead to see what a portfolio site is like for a junior/mid-level designer which is where I hope to get to within the following year. Michael Levall is a designer who has worked for a different companies and published their own titles which means they fit my career aspirations perfectly as someone to look at. They can be found here at [Michael Levall](http://www.michaellevall.com)

## Initial Glance
---
On my first initial viewing of the site the front page loads quickly and has a small file size making it snappy to get to the important projects quickly which is good. There are some nice informative and detailed write ups of his contributions to various projects which are great to see. There is however not a great many networking contacts with which to reach him with only a Twitter profile and email which even then is incorrectly formatted.

## Style and Aesthetic
---
The sites overall style and aesthetic is very simple. The formatting is very basic and provides a nice sense of minimalism to the overall theme. There's not a great deal to say here, it's a very simplistic site utilising a basic bootstrap theme commonly seen in web dev these days.

## Branding
---
There's not much in the way of branding here. The site itself has sense of dead air to it with a corporate feel through its use of just black and white with a sprinkling of blue for headers. There's not much stated about himself, it's a very simple paragraph and that coupled with the site doesn't really give you a good sense of the person and there's a lack of imagery of them. This site also seems to have no favicon which as like last time, comes across as either dead or amateurish.

## Site Usability
---
The site is very easy to use. Everything necessary is one click away from the top bar. The resume is a long block of not fantastically formatted text which makes it slightly hard to parse. The contrast ratio of his background compared to his light grey body text makes the site hard to read after a while without the use of a desaturater to darken the colors.

## Conclusion
---
Overall I'd say the site does the job it intends to. It comes across as very corporate and lifeless however and I don't get a strong sense of the person from either their website or their text. The lack of personality brings it down along with its bland colour choice. Colour is important as is getting yourself across with your site so this is something I'm going to look into having seen this. Ensuring I have a strong about me and good personality through either colour or design choice would benefit me I feel.
