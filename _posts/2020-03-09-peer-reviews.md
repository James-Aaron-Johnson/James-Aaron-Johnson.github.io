I've been tasked with selecting other Games Designers sites and giving some critique and review of them with regards to my own to see if they can offer me anything to help improve my own site or to see if my site is in vein with them. 

When it comes to doing these peer reviews I've decided to do them in a hierarchical process. I'm going to start with a graduate like me and follow 3 designers through the stages of the career I want to achieve to see how my portfolio site should look for each stage of the way.
